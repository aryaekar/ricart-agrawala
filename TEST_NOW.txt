========================================
FIXED: Connection Timeout Issue
========================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Node was taking 5 minutes to connect (RMI timeout)
- Nodes couldn't reach each other

SOLUTION:
- Added 2-second connection timeout
- Increased retries from 1 to 3 attempts
- Better logging for debugging

========================================
TEST NOW:
========================================

Machine 1 (Registry Server):
  ./start_registry_server.sh

Machine 2 (Node 0):
  ./start_node.sh 192.168.137.149 0

Machine 3 (Node 1):
  ./start_node.sh 192.168.137.149 1

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
  Connected to existing NodeRegistry service
  Created and registered Node X on port 200X
  Node X is accessible at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:200X
  Node X connected to Y other node(s)    <-- Should show immediately
  Waiting 3 seconds for other nodes...
  [NodeX] Requesting critical section...

========================================
DEBUGGING:
========================================

If nodes still can't connect:

1. Check firewall on BOTH machines:
   sudo iptables -L | grep 1099
   sudo iptables -L | grep 2000

2. Test port connectivity:
   nc -zv 192.168.137.149 1099
   nc -zv 192.168.137.149 2000
   nc -zv 192.168.137.149 2001

3. Disable firewall temporarily:
   sudo systemctl stop firewalld    # OR
   sudo ufw disable

4. Check if registry is listening:
   sudo lsof -i :1099
